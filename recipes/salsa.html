    <p>Salsa is a vibrant, flavorful condiment that originates from Mexican cuisine, typically made from a blend of tomatoes, onions, peppers, and various spices. This zesty mixture can range from mild to spicy, depending on the types and amounts of peppers used, such as jalapeños or habaneros. Fresh cilantro, lime juice, and garlic often enhance its taste, adding a refreshing and aromatic quality. Salsa is versatile, serving as a dip for tortilla chips, a topping for tacos and nachos, or a condiment for grilled meats and vegetables, making it a beloved staple in many households and a highlight of festive gatherings.
