    <p>Bruschetta (pronounced brew-SKET-tah) is an Italian dish that starts with a slice of rustic Italian bread brushed with olive oil and grilled over coals until toasted. You can serve bruschetta by simply rubbing a halved garlic clove over its crusty grilled surface for a minimalist approach, or you can top bruschetta with a wide array of ingredients such as chopped tomatoes, basil, fresh mozzarella, olives, onions, artichoke hearts, and so on.
